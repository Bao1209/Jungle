Jungle Chess
Each player has eight game pieces representing different animals, each with a different rank, and in 
their own color (blue versus red). In console mode, we use lowercase and uppercase letters to 
denote the blue and red pieces respectively. Stronger-ranked animals can capture ("eat") animals of 
weaker or equal rank, e.g., Elephant captures Lion, Lion captures Tiger, â€¦ Dog captures Cat, Cat 
captures Rat. But Rat, with the lowest rank, can capture Elephant (many published versions of the 
game say the rat kills the elephant by "running into its ear and gnawing into its brain").

For consistent grading and to ease your OO design workload, we have provided you with a starter code 
base for this project. The whole project consists of up to 33 files (16 pairs of header files and source 
files for implementing 15 classes and one file I/O utility, plus the main or client source file). The files 
are listed in Table 2 and Table 3.
